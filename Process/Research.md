This is the research ChatGPT Pro returned in September of 2025 after receiving the prompt:

>_Brief: I need to do a deep historical dive on one specific block in New York City. I would like you to help me to look at historical and cultural records of this block. 

>Role: You are my highly talented research assistant who knows all of the proper places (public records, magazine articles, newspaper stories, etc) to uncover the history of a given area. You do not speculate. You do not guess. You scour the records to find accurate information. You have as much time as you need to find the highest quality information possible. 

>Job: The block in question is where the Seagram Building now stands between 52nd and 53rd and Park and Lexington. I am curious about what buildings, structures, and other things have stood on that block over the last 500 years. If you can find maps of the area with annotated information, that would be helpful. I am also interested in the surrounding buildings (those across 52nd, 53rd, Lexington, and Park) but we will deal with those on a future request. For now, please give me a detailed history of every building that has been on this block that we have a record for._

## Research Response

[![Beyond the Gilded Age: The Montana Apartments](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.9NulA6m-f_PQGkPtLvg8bAAAAA?pid=Api)](https://www.beyondthegildedage.com/2012/02/montana-apartments.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Below is a **documented, non-speculative history** of the block bounded by **Park Avenue (west), Lexington Avenue (east), East 52nd Street (south), and East 53rd Street (north)**—the present home of the Seagram Building and adjacent parcels.

## How to read this dossier

- I organize the record **by period and by street frontage**, so you can see how the block changed over time.
    
- When sources disagree, I say so; when the record is thin, I flag it rather than infer.
    
- “The site” refers to **Manhattan Tax Map Block 1307**. The Seagram Building occupies **Lot 1** on this block; other buildings on the **Lexington Avenue side** are separate lots on the same block. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))

## 1) Before the grid (pre‑1811): landscape & Indigenous context

Specific parcel‑level records do not exist for this block before the 19th century. The area sits within **Lenapehoking**, the homeland of the Lenape. For block‑level ecological and landuse reconstructions, the **Mannahatta / Welikia** project’s interactive mapping is the best available reference (you can search by today’s address and compare 1609 to today). This is **context**, not a substitute for deeds or atlases. ([The Architect's Newspaper](https://www.archpaper.com/2017/01/mannahatta-interactive-online-map/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Mannahatta interactive online map lets you find your block"))

---

## 2) Laying out the grid & avenues (1811–1850s)

- **1811 Commissioners’ Plan** mapped East 52nd and East 53rd Streets; **Lexington Avenue** did **not** exist yet. **Samuel B. Ruggles** later petitioned for it; the city opened Lexington north of Gramercy by the mid‑1830s. **Fourth Avenue** (later **Park Avenue** above 42nd Street) carried the New York & Harlem Railroad, profoundly shaping development along this corridor. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lexington Avenue"))
    
- By the **1870s–1880s**, railroad improvements (submerging/covering tracks and landscaping the center malls) and eventual renaming to **Park Avenue** (formalized north of Grand Central by **1888**) set the stage for higher‑end residential construction on Park. ([NYC Parks](https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=12386&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Park Avenue South Malls - Historical Signs"))
    

---

## 3) 1859–1906: **Steinway & Sons** era on Park Avenue (east side of Park, 52nd→53rd)

- **1859/1860:** **Steinway & Sons** erect a **piano finishing/manufacturing complex** spanning the Park Avenue (then Fourth Avenue) frontage of this block. A **new wing opened in 1863**, and the company **built townhouses for Steinway family members along East 52nd Street**. The plant ultimately employed hundreds; Steinway later moved heavy manufacturing to Queens (Astoria) by **1879**, while retaining Manhattan facilities for finishing/showrooms. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    
- Visual documentation includes an 1860s engraving of the **Steinway Piano‑Forte Manufactory** covering **Fourth Avenue between 52nd & 53rd Streets**. (NYPL/Byron Company & Wurts Bros. collections also document the complex and later conditions.) ([Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASteinway_fab_4th_ave_nyc.jpg?utm_source=chatgpt.com "File:Steinway fab 4th ave nyc.jpg - Wikimedia Commons"))
    
- **1906:** the **Steinway site is sold**, clearing the way for redevelopment of the Park Avenue frontage. ([Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/02/from-the-vault-375-park-avenue/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Old New York: The History of 375 Park Avenue"))
    

**What else stood on the block in this period?**  
In addition to the Steinway works on Park Avenue, **rowhouses and tenements** lined the **East 52nd** and **East 53rd** street frontages of this block—typical mid‑19th‑century brick/brownstone dwellings and small outbuildings (including stables/carriage houses). Later official summaries confirm this pattern (see §5 below). Period atlases (Perris/Sanborn/Bromley) show the footprints and uses. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))

---

## 4) 1912–1955: **The Montana Apartments** and a residential blockfront

- **1912–1919:** Architects **Rouse & Goldstone** design and complete **The Montana**, a **12‑story** apartment building that **spanned the Park Avenue blockfront between East 52nd and East 53rd Streets**—precisely where the Seagram plaza and tower stand today. Period photography (e.g., **Wurts Bros., 1928**) shows the three‑massed façade on Park Avenue. ([Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/02/from-the-vault-375-park-avenue/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Old New York: The History of 375 Park Avenue"))
    
- The **rest of the block** (off Park) remained **low‑ to mid‑rise residential**: a **nine‑story apartment house** on **East 53rd Street**, and on **East 52nd Street** a **five‑story tenement** plus a **row of four‑story buildings**. These are identified explicitly in official preservation records for the Seagram site at the time of its redevelopment. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1665.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building, First Floor Interior"))
    

---

## 5) 1955–1958: Site assembly, clearance & construction of the **Seagram Building**

- **1951–1955:** Seagram Company (Samuel Bronfman) **assembles the site** opposite Lever House; plans are filed in **March 1955**. **Demolition of the Montana and the 52nd/53rd Street buildings** occurs **June 1955–March 1956**. Contemporary press and later summaries document the clearance and schedule. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1665.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building, First Floor Interior"))
    
- **1956–1958:** **Seagram Building**, **375 Park Avenue**, designed by **Ludwig Mies van der Rohe** with **Philip Johnson** (Kahn & Jacobs, associate architects), rises with its paradigm‑setting **setback plaza** and **38‑story** bronze‑and‑glass slab. The **landmarked site** is designated **Manhattan Block 1307, Lot 1**; the building officially opened **May 22, 1958**. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    
- **Site geometry note:** the **north (53rd Street) side** includes a **~7‑foot‑wide alley** facing the adjoining 100 East 53rd Street parcel, accommodating symmetry on an irregularly shaped lot. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagram_Building?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building"))

## 6) After Seagram (1958–present): what else has stood **on the same block**

Remember: the Seagram Building occupies much of the block, but **the Lexington Avenue edge of the same block** has always contained **separate properties**.

### a) **610 Lexington Avenue / 100 East 53rd Street (SW corner of Lex & 53rd)**

- **1912–1915:** the **YWCA** develops/uses a purpose‑built complex here, notable for housing **one of the first public swimming pools in New York State**. It served as the YWCA’s national offices/residence for decades. ([YWCA of the City of New York](https://ywcanyc.org/about-the-yw/history/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "History - YWCA of the City of New York"))
    
- **2001–2005:** property placed on the market; YWCA moves its New York City HQ. ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2001/08/14/midtown-ywca-on-the-block/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "MIDTOWN YWCA ON THE BLOCK"))
    
- **2014–2019:** on the same parcel rises **100 East 53rd Street** (also known as **Selene**, formerly “610 Lexington Avenue”), a **Foster + Partners** 63‑/64‑story residential tower with a **nine‑story base**, **completed 2019**. Multiple architectural sources and the developer confirm it **replaced the old YWCA building**. ([ArchDaily](https://www.archdaily.com/483076/norman-foster-s-ultra-thin-condominum-tower-to-rise-above-seagram-building?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Norman Foster's Ultra-Thin Condominum Tower to Rise ..."))
    

### b) **600 Lexington Avenue (NW corner of Lex & 52nd)**

- **1984:** **600 Lexington Avenue**, a **36‑story** tower by **Emery Roth & Sons**, is completed at the **north‑west corner of Lexington & 52nd**—the block’s **southeast corner lot**. Later descriptions of the property consistently place it at this corner. ([Looking For Space](https://lookingforspace.com/building/new-york/10022/600-lexington-avenue/259?utm_source=chatgpt.com "600 Lexington Avenue , New York, NY 10022"))
    

### c) **Cultural footnote on this block’s 52nd/Lex corner**

- The famous **Marilyn Monroe “subway‑grate” scene** for _The Seven Year Itch_ (1954) is widely associated with the **south‑west corner of Lexington Avenue & East 52nd Street**—i.e., this block’s **Lexington/52nd** corner. (The scene’s precise filming logistics are debated; citing here as a cultural association.) ([Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d10533507-Reviews-Marilyn_Monroe_s_subway_grate-New_York_City_New_York.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Marilyn Monroe's subway grate (2025) - All You Need to ..."))

## 7) What stood, where, and when — **frontage-by-frontage** (documented highlights)

**Park Avenue frontage (west edge of the block)**

- **c. 1859–1906:** **Steinway & Sons** factory/finishing works. **New wing 1863**. ([Finding Aids](https://findingaids.library.nyu.edu/nyhs/pr166_steinway_sons_collection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steinway & Sons Photograph and Print Collection"))
    
- **1912–1955:** **The Montana Apartments** by **Rouse & Goldstone** (12 stories), spanning the entire Park Avenue blockfront (52nd→53rd). ([Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/02/from-the-vault-375-park-avenue/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Old New York: The History of 375 Park Avenue"))
    
- **1956–present:** **Seagram Building** and **Seagram Plaza**. (Opened 1958; landmark.) ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    

**East 52nd Street frontage (south edge)**

- **19th–early 20th c.:** **Rowhouses/tenements**; including **Steinway family townhouses** on 52nd (1860s). By **1955**, records identify a **five‑story tenement and a row of four‑story buildings** along this side. ([Finding Aids](https://findingaids.library.nyu.edu/nyhs/pr166_steinway_sons_collection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Steinway & Sons Photograph and Print Collection"))
    
- **1958–present:** the Seagram Building’s **low‑rise eastern service/wing components** occupy most of this frontage; **600 Lexington Avenue (1984)** occupies the **Lexington & 52nd** corner of the same block. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    

**East 53rd Street frontage (north edge)**

- **Pre‑1955:** **Nine‑story apartment building** mid‑block (plus Montana on Park); **YWCA** at **Lex & 53rd** corner by the 1910s. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1665.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building, First Floor Interior"))
    
- **1958–present:** the Seagram Building’s **low‑rise northern wing** fronts much of 53rd; at the **Lexington corner**, the **YWCA** remained until the 2000s and then gave way to **100 East 53rd (Selene)**, completed **2019**. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    

**Lexington Avenue frontage (east edge of the block)**

- **By 1912–15:** **YWCA** complex at **610 Lexington** with noted pool; later vacated/sold. ([YWCA of the City of New York](https://ywcanyc.org/about-the-yw/history/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "History - YWCA of the City of New York"))
    
- **1984:** **600 Lexington Avenue** (36 stories) at **Lex & 52nd** (NW corner of the intersection). ([Looking For Space](https://lookingforspace.com/building/new-york/10022/600-lexington-avenue/259?utm_source=chatgpt.com "600 Lexington Avenue , New York, NY 10022"))
    
- **2019:** **Selene / 100 East 53rd** (Foster + Partners) at **Lex & 53rd** (SW corner of the intersection). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selene_%28building%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Selene (building)"))

## 8) Maps and how to verify lot‑by‑lot (primary cartographic sources)

Use the following to **see building footprints, uses, and ownership** for this exact block across time:

- **NYPL Atlases (Bromley “Land Books”)** – _Plate 78_ (covering **E 53rd to E 47th; Third to Fifth**), multiple editions (c. 1911, 1916, 1923, 1930s). These plates show this block (Park↔Lex; 52nd↔53rd) with footprints/lot lines and owner names. (If the NYPL viewer redirects, use the plate index and Map Warper to zoom directly to the block.) ([NYPL Digital Collections](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/ccdd0900-45a0-0132-fed9-58d385a7bbd0?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plate 78: [Bounded by E. 53rd Street, Third Avenue, E. 47th ..."))
    
- **Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (LOC index; NYPL guides)** – identify volumes covering this block (1890–1951) using the **Sanborn Volume Finder**, then open the relevant sheets to see **construction materials, height, uses** for each structure on the block. ([ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/instant/interactivelegend/index.html?appid=9057c35cdabe4c57b821aac42fa33d1f&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Sanborn Volume Finder: Manhattan & The Bronx, New York"))
    
- **Historical map guidance** – NYPL tutorials on finding old maps by location will speed up georeferencing and cross‑date comparisons for this specific block. ([NYPL](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/03/14/finding-old-maps-map-warper?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Find Old Maps by Location with Map Warper"))

## 9) Key documentary summaries about **what was on the Seagram site**

- The **NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission** Seagram reports include a concise **“History of the Site”**: **Steinway manufactory on Park (1860s)**; on the rest of the block, **brick‑faced tenements (E 53rd) and brick/brownstone rowhouses (E 52nd)**; later, at time of demolition: **Montana (12 stories) on Park, a 9‑story apt on E 53rd, and a five‑story tenement and a row of four‑story buildings on E 52nd**. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    
- Additional period confirmation: **Commercial Observer’s** archival timeline for **375 Park** and **MCNY Wurts Bros. photos** of the **Montana**. ([Commercial Observer](https://commercialobserver.com/2014/02/from-the-vault-375-park-avenue/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Old New York: The History of 375 Park Avenue"))

## 10) Today on this block (quick snapshot)

- **Seagram Building & Plaza** (375 Park; 1958; landmark). ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1664.pdf "Sseagram Building, Including the Plaza"))
    
- **600 Lexington Avenue** (1984; 36 stories; Emery Roth & Sons) on the **Lex & 52nd** corner of the same block. ([Looking For Space](https://lookingforspace.com/building/new-york/10022/600-lexington-avenue/259?utm_source=chatgpt.com "600 Lexington Avenue , New York, NY 10022"))

## What’s still possible to compile (if you want to go all the way to **lot‑by‑lot**)

To build a comprehensive **address‑by‑address roster** for every known structure on this block across time (owners, architects, permits, demolition dates), the best next sources are:

- **Office for Metropolitan History – Manhattan New Building (NB) Database, 1900–1986.** Search all relevant frontages: _375 Park Avenue; East 52nd (Park→Lex); East 53rd (Lex→Park); 600–610 Lexington Avenue_. This yields specific NB permits (year, architect, stories) for each building erected on the block during that period. ([Office for Metropolitan History](https://www.metrohistory.com/permit-search?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Permit Search — Office for Metropolitan History"))
    
- **NYC Municipal Archives – 1940s Tax Photos** for each tax lot on **Block 1307** (visual confirmation of buildings just before the Seagram clearance).
    
- **DOB BIS / NOW** entries (demolition permits 1955–56), and **Real Estate Record & Guide** announcements for earlier sales/redevelopments (e.g., 1906 sale of Steinway site). ([Library of Congress Tile](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ndnp/dlc/batch_dlc_lewis_ver01/data/sn83030214/00206531423/1911060801/0170.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "agt Gumpreclit Sausage Co et al (acting t") )
    

If you’d like me to, I can take those datasets and produce a **tabular ledger (by lot & address)** with dates, architects, and uses, keyed to atlas plates and photos.

### Selected images & visual documentation (highly relevant)

- **The Montana, 375 Park Avenue** (Rouse & Goldstone, c. 1912; Wurts Bros. photo, 1928). The image at top. ([collections.mcny.org](https://collections.mcny.org/Collection/-24UFQEPYV14.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "East Side Park Ave. 52 to 53rd St. [Montana Apartments.]"))
    
- **Seagram site and building**, general views and plaza, for context. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagram_Building?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building"))
    

---

## Notes on certainty & scope

- **Pre‑1850s**: no parcel‑level building record; the safest approach is to treat material before the railroad era as **landscape context** (Lenape homeland, later farms/estates), then shift to **maps/permits** once the grid and railroad drove urbanization here. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannahatta_Project?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Mannahatta Project"))
    
- **1890s–1950s**: **Sanborn/Bromley** plates plus **NB permits** enable precise lot‑by‑lot reconstruction. Where I’ve used official designation reports, I’ve quoted their consolidated descriptions for the **Seagram site** to avoid over‑interpreting atlas symbols. ([NYC Media](https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1665.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Seagram Building, First Floor Interior"))

### Would you like me to go **address‑by‑address** next?

I can extract and reconcile **all NB permits (1900–1986)** for Block 1307 and match them to **Sanborn/Bromley plates**, then produce a **single, dated ledger** of every building known to have stood on **each lot** of this block (with architects, stories, and uses). That would be the most exhaustive, court‑defensible version of the history you asked for.

---

## Bias Check

- **Source bias:** The Landmarks reports (and architecture press) understandably center the **Seagram Building**; that can under‑represent earlier **working‑class housing** and **industrial** uses on E 52nd/E 53rd. I tempered this by citing designation‑report **site history** sections and flagging the diversity of structures pre‑1955.
    
- **Map bias:** **Sanborn/Bromley** atlases were made for **insurance/valuation**; they emphasize fire risk and structures, not tenancy or social history.
    
- **Blind spot risk:** We have strong documentation from **1860s onward**; truly granular **pre‑1850** documentation is scarce at the block scale. For social context (tenants, businesses), city directories, census schedules, and the 1940 tax photos would round this out.
    

## Counter‑Argument

One could argue that focusing on **buildings** alone misses the more consequential story: the block’s transformation from **industrial/manufacturing** (Steinway & the Park Avenue rail corridor) to **luxury residential** (The Montana) to **iconic corporate modernism** (Seagram), and then to a **mixed office–residential** edge on Lexington (600 Lex, Selene). If your objective is to understand the **forces** that shaped Midtown, a **systems view**—rail infrastructure, zoning (1916/1961), corporate land assembly post‑WWII, preservation policy—may be more revealing than a lot‑by‑lot inventory. My recommendation is to pair the building ledger with a brief **structural narrative** tying each redevelopment wave to infrastructure and policy shifts.
