## 09.23.25 | Beginning Statement[^1]

The general idea here is a more ambiguous, experiential, and non-linear experience than [An Invitation to Play](https://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/aitp/) While that soundwalk was successful in what it set out to do (namely foster a playful attitude through the medium of soundwalk), it felt a little too... stuffy? It worked really well to use Echos in a linear way (go from area one to area two, trying to set an ideal speed), and was very much in line with a Cardiff-influenced walk, but it definitely felt like trying to choreograph a hidden ballet of cats. Additionally, the linear/prescriptive nature felt very restricting, especially as I move towards thinking more about the contemplative aspects/potential of soundwalks for the [Aesthetics of Contemplative Play](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/planetVelocityMap) thesis work.

At ICMC, I was especially taken with Christina Campanella's [Traces](https://explore.echoes.xyz/collections/6UbRIosluXC02wMw). The composing is excellent, but also the way that the sounds come in and out and interlace with each other is really quite nice. This new piece is going to be highly inspired by Christina's piece. Additionally, recognizing the way that less obvious sound presentation could contribute to a contemplative experience, created some ideas for possible presentation. Eventually I settled on the idea of overlaying a number of complex sounds (narration, field-recording, music) over a given area. I decided on the Seagram building's block in NYC (52nd to Lex to 53rd to Park) because of the potential history there as well as my own personal connection to the building and area.

With all this in mind, the stated goals for this project are:
- Ambiguous sounds - maybe it isn't even possible to discern what the stories are about, or maybe they only get louder if you stay in one position for long enough, actively choosing with your body what to focus on by keeping still
- Overlapping music motifs that are co-composed through spatial movement
- Non-linear - the participant can walk in any direction around the block, (maybe even zig-zagging, back and forth, cutting through courtyards) and the piece will work
- Non-directive - no 'presenter's voice' telling them where to go or what to think about
- Trying to capture the depth of a space - it's history, culture, etc - through the variety and wealth of sounds presented
- Experiential spatial storytelling - the participant might not know the full extent of the story presented, but through the experience has gleaned some aspect

There's a lot here. First steps will be to come up with a list of potential sonic cues/items. Next.
## 09.24.25 | Initial Ideas

A quick list of things that come to mind as possible sound cues:
- Brent taking about the closing of the Four Seasons and the subsequent auction 
- [that 99pi story about the Citicorp building](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity/)
- Interviews with doormen
- Audio from [The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QkJkT3M-Us)
- Field recordings
- Audio from St Patricks (choir, mass, etc)
- A sonic art-piece in the Seagram courtyard (in the places that they display art)
- Snow, different weather in general
- Holiday sounds
- Tenements / Residential sounds
- Racket Club
- Grand Central
- The story of Andy and I sitting on the median
- Lever House

Next step is to do some deep research to find out what exactly had been on the block over the last 500 years. I will experiment with leveraging ChatGPT Pro to help in the data collection, which will hopefully lead to some interesting finds. This will then of course inform new ideas for possible sounds.

## 09.26.25 | Research

Using ChatGPT Pro I got a full [research report](Research.md) on the history of the Seagram block (which for the record, is officially known as Tax Map Block 1307[^2]), and there is so much fun stuff in here. 

Some highlights:
- the [Mannahatta/Welikia] project describes any block in the NYC area from pre-development and Indigenous context
- At that time it was an appalachian oak-hickory forest that most likely served as a hunting ground for the Lenape people
- The forest was home to 12 mammal species (squirrel, cottentail, schrew, beaver, white-tailed deer, raccoon, etc) and 28 bird species (red-tailed hawk, jay, crow, robin, towhee, wild turkey, wren, etc) This is obviously great content for a 'forest sounds' section of the walk
- The New York & Harlem Railroad 4th avenue train line ran down Park (then called 4th) from ~1830 to 1888
- The Steinway & Sons finishing manufactory was there from 1860-1910
- The Steinway family owned townhouses along 52nd on the lot from 1863 to the early 20th century
- The [Montana Apartments](http://www.beyondthegildedage.com/2012/02/montana-apartments.html) replaced the Steinway factory and was there from 1912-1956 when the Segram building was built
- From 1912-1915 the YWCA was at the SW corner of Lex and 53rd and housed the first public swimming pool in New York State

There's tons of linked out maps and resources which are going to be really fun to go through. Some initial thoughts from looking at the maps:
- There is a [St. Zita's Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_O%27Keefe) listed on Plate 78 of the 1923 [Bromley "Land Books"](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/cc464800-45a0-0132-628a-58d385a7bbd0?canvasIndex=0)[^3] in addition to the YWCA, meaning that there was a pretty big presence of caring for women on this particular block.
- The [Sanborn Fire Insurance Map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/instant/interactivelegend/index.html?appid=9057c35cdabe4c57b821aac42fa33d1f)[^4] from 1892 shows the Steinway manufacturing but also stables in the middle of where the plaza is now, a hospital (which I can't find any other record of), and a carpenter shop across on the SW corner of Park and 52nd
- [This Map from 1854](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/4690ca20-c603-012f-4a1b-58d385a7bc34?canvasIndex=0) shows that the space was stables for the 4th Avenue Stagecoach (!!) Line
- This is a legit rabbit hole

Obviously there's a lot of sound-based stuff that can come out of this research. I think the next steps are to roughly block out which sections are telling which 'story' of the block. After that it'll be time to start composing.

[^2]: Which would be a great name for the piece maybe? Block 1307. Even just 1307. Can you change the names of projects on GitHub? Probably, yeah?
