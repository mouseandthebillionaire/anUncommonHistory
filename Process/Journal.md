The general idea here is a more ambiguous, experiential, and non-linear experience than [An Invitation to Play](https://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/aitp/) While that soundwalk was successful in what it set out to do (namely foster a playful attitude through the medium of soundwalk), it felt a little too... stuffy? It worked really well to use Echos in a linear way (go from area one to area two, trying to set an ideal speed), and was very much in line with a Cardiff-influenced walk, but it definitely felt like trying to choreograph a hidden ballet of cats. Additionally, the linear/prescriptive nature felt very restricting, especially as I move towards thinking more about the contemplative aspects/potential of soundwalks for the [Aesthetics of Contemplative Play](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/planetVelocityMap) thesis work.

At ICMC, I was especially taken with Christina Campanella's [Traces](https://explore.echoes.xyz/collections/6UbRIosluXC02wMw). The composing is excellent, but also the way that the sounds come in and out and interlace with each other is really quite nice. This new piece is going to be highly inspired by Christina's piece. Additionally, recognizing the way that less obvious sound presentation could contribute to a contemplative experience, created some ideas for possible presentation. Eventually I settled on the idea of overlaying a number of complex sounds (narration, field-recording, music) over a given area. I decided on the Seagram building's block in NYC (52nd to Lex to 53rd to Park) because of the potential history there as well as my own personal connection to the building and area.

With all this in mind, the stated goals for this project are:
- Ambiguous sounds - maybe it isn't even possible to discern what the stories are about, or maybe they only get louder if you stay in one position for long enough, actively choosing with your body what to focus on by keeping still
- Overlapping music motifs that are co-composed through spatial movement
- Non-linear - the participant can walk in any direction around the block, (maybe even zig-zagging, back and forth, cutting through courtyards) and the piece will work
- Non-directive - no 'presenter's voice' telling them where to go or what to think about
- Trying to capture the depth of a space - it's history, culture, etc - through the variety and wealth of sounds presented
- Experiential spatial storytelling - the participant might not know the full extent of the story presented, but through the experience has gleaned some aspect

There's a lot here. First steps will be to come up with a list of potential sonic cues/items. Next.
